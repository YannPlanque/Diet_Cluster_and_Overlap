# Diet_Cluster_and_Overlap
Diet analyses.
Identification of diet clusters and interspecific dietary overlap by analysing the content of harbour and grey seal scats in functionnal prey. 

This script can be run with diet data structured like this: the content of each sample (rows; e.g. scats, stomachs) in prey consummed in mass (columns). 

This script was developped as part of the article "Trophic niche overlap between sympatric harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) at their Southern European limit range (Eastern English Channel)" by Yann Planque, Jérôme Spitz, Matthieu Authier, Cécile Vincent and Florence Caurant, submitted in Ecology & Evolution journal.

Data used in this script are freely available on SEANOE: Planque Yann, Vincent Cécile, Caurant Florence, Spitz Jérôme (2020). Content of harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) and grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) scats in prey classified by functional groups (samples collected in the baie de Somme, France, from 2002 to 2019).

Before running the script, please download the file repository in the ZIP file and place it on your desktop. Place the data previously dowloaded in the subfile "Input".
