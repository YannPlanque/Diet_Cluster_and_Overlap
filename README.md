# Identifying diet clusters and interspecific overlap
### **CASE STUDY**: Harbour and grey seal diets from scat content analysis (in the *Baie de Somme*, France)
• **OBJECTIVES** : Analyse diet content data (here scat contents) to compare the diets of two predator species (here harbour and grey seals). We aimed here at **quantifying the diet** (with the associated confidence interval) and **identifying different diet clusters** based on the composition of scats in functional prey (identified from the analysis of diagnostic hard parts). The distribution of samples in clusters is expected to inform on the typical diet contents found. We also aimed at using the **Pianka index** to compare two diet data sets, and measure the overlap.

• **METHOD** : 
This script can be run with diet data structured like this: the content of each sample (rows; e.g. scats, stomachs) in prey consummed in mass (columns). 

• **LANGUAGE** : R (version 4.0.2).

• **CASE STUDY** : harbour seals and grey seals captured in the *Baie de Somme* (France)
